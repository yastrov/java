## Motivation
I want to try Java GUI programming and I want to have a notification client for [http://www.diary.ru](http://www.diary.ru).

## Skills
Work with: TrayIcon, Netbeans GUI designer, requests to russian web server at windows-1251 encoding (with org.apache.http library), parsing response JSON (com.springsource.org.json), get data from JFrame via callback handler.

## Why Netbeans
I like no other builtin GUI designers at this time.

## Installation
Create at the folder, where .jar file two icons: deficon.png and aticon.png.

## Problems
All-in-one JAR is very hard problem for creation.
